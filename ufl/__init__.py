"""The Unified Form Language is an embedded domain specific
language for definition of variational forms intended for
finite element discretization. More precisely, it defines
a fixed interface for choosing finite element spaces and
defining expressions for weak forms in a notation close
to mathematical notation.

This python module contains the language as well as
algorithms to work with it.

- To import the language, type:
      from ufl import *

- To import the underlying classes an UFL expression tree
  is built from, type:
      from ufl.classes import *

- Various algorithms for working with UFL expression trees
  can be found in:
      from ufl.algorithms import *

The classes and algorithms are considered implementation
details and should not be used in form definitions.

For more details on the language, see the manual or the
wiki pages at

  http://www.fenics.org/wiki/UFL/

The development version can be found in the repository at

  http://www.fenics.org/hg/ufl/

########## README
# Imports here should be what the user sees when doing "from ufl import *",
# which means we should _not_ import f.ex. "Grad", but "grad".
# This way we expose the language, the operation "grad", but less
# of the implementation, the particular class "Grad".
